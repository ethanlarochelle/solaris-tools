# Overview
This repository is intended to contain a number of utilities
that can be used to interact with data collected by the PerkinElmer
Solaris imaging system. Very limited testing has been done to verify
functionality.

## Solaris Batch Export
This is a iPython (Jupyter) notebook written to batch convert data into
image files that can be analyzed using third-party software. 
It was written using Python 3.4

## Future tools
Other scripts to analyze video content have also been developed. As 
these and future tools are tested for minimum functionality they will 
be added to this repository.
